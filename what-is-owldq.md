# What is OwlDQ

## The One Missing Tool in Your Toolset That Eliminates Data Quality Headaches At Scale 

OwlDQ is an intelligent service that reduces the heavy lifting involved in data monitoring. It is built for data professionals that want to be efficient.

## What Actually Happens

Without efficient data monitoring built-in by design, the biggest issues are the things you never expect.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Billing Issue Example" %}
| "An unexpected ETL update occurred during a migration that changed our up-to-date-payments indicator from TRUE/FALSE to 1/0. Needless to say, we were very surprised when invoices were not sent. The rework and reconciliation were super painful. An enormous amount of my time was wasted." |
| :--- |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Financial Data Example" %}
| "One of our 200+ reference data feeds introduced a pipe \(\|\) into a position field. The field was defined as VARCHAR so this was allowed. Our models went crazy and we thought we breached risk limits. We ended up selling out of positions \(losing millions\). Only to uncover the root cause much later that week." |
| :--- |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="API Example" %}
| "We pull data from many APIs. One platform accounts for 10% of enrichment activities \(i.e. how we monetize our data\). Our auth token accidentally had a daily quota imposed, yet job control said green light \(successful connection\). We still loaded some rows \(1k\), just not entire payloads. This was super nuanced. We literally lost ~10% revenue that month." |
| :--- |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="IoT / Meter Example" %}
| "When we introduced new meters, they were hooked up and sending valid readings. They were valid values within valid ranges. Turned out their default setting was rounding the actual values and we were losing precision. Devastating, considering the amount of precision required with blood values." |

## What Sets OwlDQ Apart

_**OwlDQ is the only tool that**_ 

* Contains all-in-one analysis, autodiscovery, workflows, and reporting
* Allows UI-driven and programmatic workflows 
* Deploys on-prem or within distributed and cloud environments
* Provides enterprise security, encryption, and masking functionality

OwlDQ enables organizations to quickly do things that would _**otherwise take months to develop and cost significantly more.**_

## **Purpose-Built \(One Focus\)**

{% hint style="info" %}
### _Every feature, visual, and component within Owl is intended to make the analysis and implementation of data quality easier._
{% endhint %}

Owl was designed with 4 KPI's in mind:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Speed" %}
Owl will check that data is valid, complete, accurate, and consistent.  Data Quality is derived from intuitive clicks, not unnecessary code. Our goal is to deliver DQ in minutes, not days or weeks. 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Scale" %}
Owl considers scale from two perspectives. From a technical viewpoint, OwlDQ is designed to work in distributed and elastic environments. It can scan any data from any location. The other piece is usability. Creating a tool that will scale to additional users, outside of a few experts, is equally important.  
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Measurement" %}
You can't manage what you can't measure. It's important to get macro and micro views of data quality, the ability to compare between different departments, and time periods. 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Unification" %}
OwlDQ will scan files the same way as a database so you can do all in your data monitoring in one place, rather than piecemeal approaches.  Data quality needs to be unified to have a single normalized view of data health. ****
