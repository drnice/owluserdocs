# Builds a Better DQ Dashboard

* **DQ Dashboards.**  Many DQ problems result from an improper or a too slow observation of business rules related to the data.  What is not caught by handmade visual inspection or a potentially outdated man-made rule can only be flagged by AI Machine Learning.  Conversely, what does get flagged should also be easily triaged and then immediately fixed with the aid of AI.  The most important metric for a DQ Dashboard is the time to fix, not simply the overall DQ score.
