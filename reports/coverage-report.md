## How to Generate a Data Quality Coverage Report

In the explorer view where you see the file tree explorer for each database you can click the pie chart \[coverage report\].  This will show all the datasets that have been cataloged and that have DQ jobs running.  The time-series bars shows the run level information aggregated by month, while the donut chart shows the percent coverage of the entire database or schema.
