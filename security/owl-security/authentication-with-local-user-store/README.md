# Authentication With Local User Store

Local user store authentication is enabled by default, and the product ships with a default user with admin privileges. If you should need to toggle this mechanism on/off you can find the setting by navigating to the Admin Console and clicking on the Security Icon. The setting labeled "Local User Store Enabled" when checked will allow your company to create and administer users stored in Owl's internal database user store. Toggling this feature will require a restart of the web application.
