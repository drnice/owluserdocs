# FAQ

## Can anyone assign an item?

Anyone with access to the dataset and TRAIN role \(if enabled\) can assign an item. Users who have been assigned an item can resolve without the TRAIN role.

## How do I add people to the assignment list

Once a person logs into the Owl Application they will get a profile and become eligible for assignment.
